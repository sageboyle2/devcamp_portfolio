    <p class="lead text-muted">This is my first album titled "Songs For You", taken from a song on the album. Creating this took me on a long journey. I started writing for it in October 2015, while I was still 14 years old, and it wasn't until July of 2017 that I finalized everything and released it on YouTube.</p>
